# The Fisherman and the Monk

At the base of a great monastery flowed the mighty Li river. There lived a lowly fisherman. He came from a long line who had toiled to make a life catching and selling whatever they could from those waters. So completely had this life defined his family that he was named "He" which meant "river or stream." 

Monks from the monastery would buy fish that He caught. Occasionally, He would climb the arduous staircase named "The Ten Thousand Steps" to sell extra fish to very grateful monks. Doubtless, he needn't make the trek to sell fish. Instead, He did it to see the wonderful things done and kept there. He wondered at the skill of the monks, the beautiful construction of their buildings, and the sweet fragrance of camphor and sandalwood that entranced his imagination. 

Wonderful as it all was, He grew more uneasy about his visits. He began to notice how much more like fish and river he smelled than incense. The monks he spoke with had close shaved heads that seemed like brass orbs open to the mysteries of the heavens while his own was bound to float up and downstream, ignorant of those more excellent things.

Eventually, He stopped climbing those steps. When monks would visit him, he kept his head bowed and eyes low to avoid their gaze. Surely they thought of him as a dullard -- an uncultered simpleton. Eventually, he avoided the monks altogether.

One steamy summer evening, he was disturbed by a knock on his door. He had been preparing to take his boat our for an evening fish. Upon opening his door and to his alarm, a monk politely greeted him. The man's body was lithe and strong though he was well on in years. "Hello friend," said the monk. "My name is Ling. I fear I've overestimated my strength and won't be able to ascend the Ten Thousand Steps before the moonless night arrives." He silently stared for an uncomfortable time before hastily stepping out and shutting his door. In an instant, the near forgotten feelings of shame flooded over him. He had been cleaning fish for drying and worried that the smell would be offensive to the serene-looking month. "Y-yes. I've climbed those steps many times myself. It will be dangerous for you to return now." 

Another pregnant pause hung in the air. Ling gently swatted swarming river insects away from his face. All at once, He realized why the monk was at his door. He...he wanted to be invited to stay the night! Panic swirled and mixed into his anxiety. But, what could be done? He would surely offend the monk and certainly hospitality itself should he refuse. Meekly, he offered, "Y-you should stay here...uh with me tonight," adding quickly, "...that is...of course...if you want to." The monk's demeanor didn't shift from it's solid serenity. "How kind. Yes, I would stay with you." 

What followed was a hasty and meager supper of dried fish, rice, and fermented bean curd. Ling ate it with a surprising relish.  As they ate and talked, He found his heart calmed somewhat. He told the Ling how he admired the monastery and the monks. He shared how he had made special trips up Ten Thousand Steps just so he could speak to the other monks and smell the sweet incense. "Why did you stop?" queried Ling. Fresh feelings of embarassment and even guilt arose for He. Ling had clearly not been offended by his smelly home or his humble food. Why had he stopped? "Forgive me..." whispered He, "I...am not like the monks there. I am not wise or, or intelligent enough to..." He paused. Ling smiled and slowly nodded, inviting him to continue without fear. He screwed up his courage and blurted out, "I am not strong enough, intelligent enough, patient enough, dedicated enough, mindful enough...special enough to be a monk!" 

Another long pause lingered for what seemed to He as an eternity. Ling, for his part, didn't disturb the discomfort by speaking. What did was strange indeed. A sound like low, gutteral chirping. First one, then several in chorus began. "What is that noise?" asked Ling. "That noise tells me I must go to the river and fish. Those are my birds." He explained to Ling that he used trained cormorants to catch the fish he ate and sold for his livelihood. In all his travels, Ling had never heard of such a thing. "May I accompany you?"

coaching scrum sometimes feels like this: a man walks into a personal trainers office

excuse me, I need some help getting into shape. ok, I can help you with that. I've got some of the best track results in the industry. Excellent, that's just what I'm after. You see, my doctor, Dr Gartner, tells me my weight is causing a number of health problems. Beyond those, I want to live to a ripe old age and still have my health when I'm in my 70's and 80's. Ok, I can help you with tha as well. Not only can I build a workout plan for you, I can a registered dietician and can design a diet that best helps you achieve the health results you're after.

Ok, let's get started. What do I do to be more health? For starters, I think we should start with some basic dieting first. Lower your sugar, salt, and bad carbohydrate intake, eath every 2.5 to 3 hrs, and drink at least 64 oz of water every day. You should try to eat within 30 minutes of waking up, even if it's only 100-200 calories. Regarding exercise, I want you to start by limbering up a bit and working on your cardiovascular endurance. Start by doing 20 minutes of walking, 25 sit-up, 10 pushups, and 20 jumping jacks each morning. Ideally, you could do them early in the morning, but anytime throughout the day should be fine for this first month. After one month, come back and we'll see how things are going with you.

Oh thank you. I've heard about this personal health training stuff. My friends have seen great results, and I'm eager to show them I can do it too. I'll see you in 30 days.

Very good, but before you go we need to take some information and biometrics from you. Could you step on this scale please? What, why? Could I just tell you my weight? It's just standard procedure. We need to measure your weight precisely in controlled conditions. Well, I suppose I could try it out. *confused* ok, step on the scale please.
